# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge

## Initial Prediction: 
I predict that the Random Forest regression algorithm will be more accurate because the dataset has 77,536 and the random forest classifier method works well with larger datasets. Additionally, this method automatically balances the data set and utilizes multiple decision trees by resampling the data each time instead of one complex decision tree. This avoids error or missing trends. 

## Analysis

The Logistic Regression Score was: <br> 0.9919177328380795
<br>
The Random Forest Score was: <br> 
0.9971798046498831
<br>
The Random Forest Score was slightly more accurate than the Logistic Regression Score because it was closer to 1. My initial prediction was correct.
